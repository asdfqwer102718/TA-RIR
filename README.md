## TA-RIR: Topology-Aware Neural Modeling of Acoustic Propagation for Room Impulse Response Synthesis


The implement of the paper [TA-RIR: Topology-Aware Neural Modeling of Acoustic Propagation for Room Impulse Response Synthesis](TA-RIR_Topology_Aware_Neural_Modeling_of_Acoustic_Propagation_for_Room_Impulse_Response_Synthesis.pdf).









This project uses a third-party implementation of the method described in Filtered Noise Shaping for Time Domain Room Impulse Response Estimation from Reverberant Speech. The implementation is available at [this link](https://github.com/kyungyunlee/fins).
